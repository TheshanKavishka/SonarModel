# SonarModel
The Sonar Prediction Model classifies objects as mines or rocks using sonar signal data from a Kaggle dataset. It analyzes 60 sonar signal attributes reflecting off objects under the sea, labeled as "R" for rocks or "M" for mines. Machine learning models like logistic regression or decision trees are used to predict the object's type.
